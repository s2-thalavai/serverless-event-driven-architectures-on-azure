# Serverless Event-Driven Architectures on Azure

## Event-Driven Architecture

- Event-Driven (EDA) is an architecture pattern that allows us to build highly scalable software and cloud systems. 
- The key advantage of the Event-Driven systems is having loosely coupled components and services.

Letâ€™s have a look at a basic Event-Driven system design below.

### EDA with Mediator

- In this architecture, all events are orchestrated by the Event Mediator. 
- It decides which subscriber can handle what event. 
- It can be represented as a Serverless application(Azure function or AWS Lambda), a different web application, components in the system, or any other microservice. 
- In a simple scenario, the Event Mediator does not contain any state, neither persistent nor in-memory. 
- In complex solutions, it may contain its own database.
