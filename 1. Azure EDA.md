## Azure Components:

| Layer                    | Azure Service                               | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Backbone**       | **Event Grid / Service Bus / Event Hub**    | Routes domain events between microservices            |
| **Compute (Serverless)** | **Azure Functions / Logic Apps**            | Reacts to incoming events (stateless, auto-scale)     |
| **Storage**              | **Azure SQL / Cosmos DB / Blob Storage**    | Persists P2P data (vendor, invoice, PO, etc.)         |
| **Orchestration**        | **Durable Functions / Logic Apps**          | Manages long-running workflows (approvals, payments)  |
| **Integration**          | **API Management + Function Apps**          | Provides API gateways for vendors and ERP integration |
| **Observability**        | **Application Insights + Log Analytics**    | Monitors events, latency, failures                    |
| **Security & Identity**  | **Azure AD / Managed Identity / Key Vault** | Secures secrets and inter-service calls               |

## P2P Event Flow Example

Let’s visualize an Invoice Lifecycle using Azure’s serverless ecosystem:

```
Vendor Portal (Front Door + Static Web App)
        │
        ▼
[API Management] → [Azure Function: SubmitInvoice]
        │
        ▼
→ emits → Event Grid Topic: InvoiceSubmitted
        │
        ├──> Subscriber: [Function: ValidateInvoice]
        │       ├── Checks vendor & PO validity via Cosmos DB
        │       └── Emits InvoiceValidated / InvoiceRejected
        │
        ├──> Subscriber: [Function: OCRExtraction]
        │       └── Reads from Blob (PDF invoice), enriches metadata
        │
        └──> Subscriber: [Durable Function: ApprovalWorkflow]
                ├── Waits for manager approval event
                ├── Emits InvoiceApproved
                └── Triggers downstream payment process

Event Grid → [Function: SchedulePayment]
        └── Writes PaymentRecord → Azure SQL DB
             + Sends PaymentScheduled event → Teams/SNS/Webhook

```

## Event Taxonomy

| Event Name         | Source              | Consumers                 | Payload                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `InvoiceSubmitted` | Vendor Portal       | Validation, OCR, Approval | `{ invoiceId, vendorId, blobUri, amount }` |
| `InvoiceValidated` | Validation Function | Approval Flow             | `{ invoiceId, status, errors }`            |
| `InvoiceApproved`  | Approval Flow       | Payment Scheduler         | `{ invoiceId, approver, timestamp }`       |
| `PaymentScheduled` | Payment Service     | Notification / ERP Sync   | `{ invoiceId, paymentDate, amount }`       |

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Event Routing

- Azure Event Grid for lightweight event notifications.

- Service Bus for guaranteed delivery, message ordering, and retries.

- Hybrid Model: Event Grid triggers → Service Bus queue for reliable consumption by Functions.

### 2. Data Synchronization

- Invoice metadata → Cosmos DB

- Attachments (PDFs, receipts) → Blob Storage

- PO & Vendor master → Azure SQL (multi-tenant partitioning by TenantId)

### 3. Multi-Tenant Strategy

- Use TenantId in event metadata to isolate processing.

- Event Grid Domains for tenant-scoped event routing.

- Cosmos DB containers or Elastic Pool (Azure SQL) for data isolation.

## Benefits

✅ Scalability: Auto-scale with demand; pay per execution.
✅ Loose Coupling: Services interact through events, not direct APIs.
✅ Auditability: Full event trail in Event Grid or Data Lake.
✅ Resilience: Retry policies and dead-letter queues ensure reliability.
✅ Extensibility: New subscribers (e.g., analytics or ML scoring) can be added without touching core logic.

# Multi‑Tenant P2P — Azure Serverless Event‑Driven Architecture

1. ) Key components & responsibilities

- **Azure Front Door / Static Web App:** Global fronting, TLS termination, WAF rules, CDN for vendor portal.

- **API Management:** Authn/Z, rate limiting, request validation, API versioning; exposes REST endpoints for vendors and internal systems.

- **Azure Functions:** lightweight, event-triggered compute for tasks like submission, validation, enrichment, and payment scheduling.

- **Durable Functions:** orchestrate long-running, human approval flows and complex compensation logic.

- **Event Grid (Domain):** tenant-aware event bus that emits domain events (InvoiceSubmitted, InvoiceValidated, InvoiceApproved, PaymentScheduled).
- Use Event Grid Domains for tenant-scoped topics.

- **Service Bus:** use for guaranteed delivery, ordering, and advanced retry semantics (dead-letter queues) where needed.

- **Blob Storage:** store raw invoice artifacts (PDFs), signed URLs in events.

- **Cosmos DB / Azure SQL:** Cosmos for document-like invoice metadata and high-scale reads; Azure SQL for relational master data, reporting, and ERP-sync.

- **APIs / ERP Connectors:** Logic Apps or Functions for integration with SAP / Dynamics.

- **Monitoring:** Application Insights for tracing, Log Analytics for queries and alerts.
